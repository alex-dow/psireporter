# PsiReporter
PsiReporter is a microframework for multithreaded task execution and 
broadcasting the results. It's designed for simplicity and small scale usage.

## Purpose

PsiReporter namely exists to support the project [Psistats2](https://github.com/psistats/psistats2).
But it is generic enough to be used for any project that needs to send messages to multiple destinations
at different intervals.

It is not designed to be a message queue, nor is it designed to handle a huge volume of data.
